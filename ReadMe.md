Moover Countdown Clock
======================
Displays hours, minutes, seconds countdown to next Moover arrival time.  Moover comes at 20 and 50 past the hour in the morning. Only runs on weekends and holidays.  Sketch has calculations for Thanksgiving, Christmas, MLK, and President's week.
When countdown reaches two minutes, a two minute warning will sound.  When it reaches zero and Moover has arrived sound will play and a bus will scroll across the screen.
Only plays sound in the morning.  <br>

Use real time clock to track the time.  <br>
Has two 16x32 RGB displays. [Adafruit's library](http://github.com/adafruit/RGB-matrix-Panel) does not support multiple displays, I used one from [Protonmaster RGB-matrix-Panel](http://github.com/protonmaster/RGB-matrix-Panel0)
